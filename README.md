**Torchlet** is a small, minimalist variant of PyTorch, built for educational purposes and currently under active development.

## ⚠️ Project Status: Work in Progress ⚠️
- **Torchlet** is not production-ready. Features are being added progressively, and existing code may change as the project evolves.
- The goal is to implement a focused subset of PyTorch's functionality to simplify learning and exploration.
- This project is **not optimized for performance**—its primary focus is on clarity and educational value.
- Inspired by [karpathy/micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

Stay tuned for updates!
