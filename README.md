# Torchlet
A small, minimalist variant of Pytorch. Built for educational purposes.

## Notes
- This is a work in progress. The goal is to implement a small subset of Pytorch's functionality.
- The code is not optimized for performance.
- Inspired by [karpathy/micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).
